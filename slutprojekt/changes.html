            <h1 class="ml3 ">It still does change</h1>
            <p class="introduction">Why do fashions change? The answer is probably as simple as the fact that people change. Over time, the new replaces the old. People are influenced greatly by popular culture, including athletes, musicians, movie stars, politicians, royalty, as well as popular films, television shows, books and music. We also are influenced by the fashion industry's advertising.</p>

            <p class="introduction">
                The stars of popular culture don't remain stars by doing the same things over and over again. Instead, they're always searching for a new angle to maintain their popularity. Often these new angles come in the form of new clothing or hairstyles.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p class="introduction">
                When people see these new styles, they often want to imitate their favorite stars. To do so, they seek out the latest fashions — clothes, shoes, jewelry and the like — to make themselves look like the people they want to imitate. In this way, fashions evolve and constantly change over time.
                And it's been happening for hundreds of years! Ever since clothes were invented, they've been used as a way to express something about yourself. As far back as the 1700s, the French were known to spend hours looking through fashion magazines to learn about the latest styles. </p>

            <br>
            <p class="introduction">
                For years, clothes have been used to separate people into groups. Even today, brand-name clothing that is more expensive than other types of clothing can be used by some people to distinguish themselves from others.
