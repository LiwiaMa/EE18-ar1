            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1920s">1920s</h2>
            <p class="text">1920s men’s fashion was the start of menswear as we know it today. It was a time of classic sophistication with a level of fun that has gone by the wayside in favor of more and more casual modern clothing. 1920s men’s fashion colors were mostly neutral with patterns, but the accessories popped with vibrant colors– just like they did for women’s 1920s fashion. Popular TV shows, such as Peaky Blinders, Boardwalk Empire and Downton Abbey, have brought back the appeal for 1920s men’s fashion today.</p>

            <p class="text">The essential part of a 1920s man’s wardrobe was his suit. For day, evening, work, or parties, a man always wore a suit. The only exceptions were for blue-collar workers, sport players or young teen and college men who dressed more casually, but even they owned second-hand and often mismatched suits and wore them with pride.</p>

            <p class="text">What sets 1920s men’s suits apart from other decades are the materials and how they fit. Suits were mostly made of thick wool, wool tweed, mohair, wool flannel and corduroy that made them heavier than today’s suit materials but lighter than the previous decades. Suit jackets were either single or double breasted and featured 3 or 4 buttons up the front. The top button came to the center of the heart, giving way to notch lapels that grew wider each year. The height of the suit lapels is what really sets 1920s suits apart from suits of other eras. When buttoned, jackets would completely cover vests exposing only the shirt collar and necktie. <a class="man" href="https://vintagedancer.com/1920s/1920s-fashion-men/">source</a> </p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1930s">1930s</h2>
            <p class="text">In the 1930s, men’s clothing was inspired by athletes with their broad shoulders and thin waists. Suits were wide, pants were wide, even the shirt collars were large. The styles narrowed throughout the decade until they became what we would call a classic fit today. 1930s suits were full of color and distinctive patterns — plaids, checks, and stripes mixed with beautiful solid colors. It truly was the era of men’s finest classic clothing. <a class="man" href="https://vintagedancer.com/1930s/1930s-men/">source</a></p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1940s">1940s</h2>
            <p class="text">940s men’s clothing is classic with its single and double-breasted 1940s men’s suits, wide jacket lapels, and wide-leg trousers. The pinstripe suit in navy or grey was the most iconic of the 1940s and notorious with gangsters. Inner-city youth wore zoot suits. Every man wore a felt Fedora or straw hat and a snazzy pair of two-tone shoes. <a class="man" href="https://vintagedancer.com/1940s/1940s-mens-clothing/">source</a> </p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1950s">1950s</h2>
            <p class="text">Rock n’ roll to rockabilly, nerds to dapper men, 1950s men’s fashions are all making a comeback.</p>
            <p class="text">Slim fitting suits, skinny ties, Letterman jackets, bowling shirts, saddle shoes and chunky glasses defined the 1950s guy’s wardrobe. While hats were fading from fashion, men like Frank Sinatra kept the fedora hat and black and white shoes alive a little longer. Meanwhile, musicians like Elvis introduced trendy new suede footwear and actor James Dean made the classic white T-shirt and leather jacket a must for any greaser. Jocks wore letterman jackets, blue jeans and Converse high tops. 50s nerds set a new fashion trend with horn-rim glasses, high waisted pants, and pocket protectors. Teddy Boys in England reintroduced style from the 1900s. There are 50s male fashions for every age and personality.</p>
            <p class="text">For your 50s men’s outfit, we searched the web and found many vintage, reproduction, and 1950s inspired men’s clothes to choose from. We linked to them here making your shopping easier. UK and European shoppers can look at these vintage style clothes made closer to home. <a class="man" href="https://vintagedancer.com/1950s/1950s-mens-clothing/">source</a></p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1960s">1960s</h2>
            <p class="text">1960s men’s clothing changed from the conservative-yet-relaxed 1950s fashion into far more simplified clothing. Casual was in, formality was out. By the mid ’60s, men’s fashion took a sharp turn and flew across the pond to the Mod style worn by British musicians. The Beatles, beatniks, and Steve McQueen were fashion idols for a few years until the late 60s hippie movement brought out anti-fashion bell bottom pants, crazy shirts, platform shoes, and polyester everything. This continued into the 1970s, where a return to earthy folk hippie fashion dominated the decade. ’70s disco fashion added some flashy outfits to otherwise nature-inspired colors and fabrics. Men’s bell-bottoms pants, 70s shirts, and platform shoes grooved on and off the dance floor.</p>
            <p class="text">Whatever part of the ’60s or ’70s attire you may love, there are still ways to dress in the style now. We browsed the web and linked to affordable 1960s inspired men’s clothing and 70s men’s fashion attire to make your shopping easier. Both USA and UK/Europe retailers are included. <a class="man" href="https://vintagedancer.com/1960s/1960s-mens-clothing/">source</a></p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1970s">1970s</h2>
            <p class="text">In the 1970s, fashion was all about individuality and expression. As such, many traditional fashion rules were broken and unique and androgynous looks reigned supreme. Key styles for the decade included hippie, peacock revolution, glam rock, and disco looks. Thanks to an influx of cheap clothing in the market, gents could easily showcase which group they belonged to or switch between them all.</p>
            <p class="text">In the ’70s, people often wore bold and daring outfits. While there were a variety of different looks for the decade, most of them incorporated eye-catching colors and patterns, a silhouette that was tight up top and loose down the bottom, and interesting textures, such as satin, suede, and corduroy. Essential items for the decade included bell-bottom and wide-leg pants, platform shoes, vests, long collared shirts, tight tees, turtleneck sweaters, and leisure suits amongst many others. <a class="man" href="https://www.thetrendspotter.net/70s-fashion-men/">source</a></p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1980s">1980s</h2>
            <p class="text"> The ’80s were undoubtedly an interesting time for fashion. Filled with bold designs and bright colours, the decade saw gents fully embrace trends and proudly showcase their style. Of course, over time these brave looks slowly disappeared to make way for the minimalistic ’90s and ’00s. But, they’re now making an incredible return. From bum bags and chunky sneakers to dad jeans and windbreakers, the best of the 1980s is back and better than ever.</p>
            <p class="text">he ’80s were a time of excess and maximalism for both men and women. As such, the decade featured bold styles, bright colours and eye-catching silhouettes. The ’80s also saw a variety of fashion-forward trends, including hip-hop, preppy, workout, rock, and punk styles.</p>
            <p class="text">Casual fashion in the ’80s saw gents don dad jeans in full force, often with a matching denim jacket. T-shirts and loose shirts were also popular during the time while bomber jackets, leather jackets, windbreakers, and sweaters acted as the outerwear of choice. When it came to footwear, white sneakers were the ultimate casual shoe that’s perfect for a range of looks. <a class="man" href="https://www.thetrendspotter.net/80s-fashion-men/">source</a></p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1990s">1990s</h2>
            <p class="text">When it comes to fashion, we often look to the past for inspiration and ideas. This season, the decade that has captured the attention of designers and stylish gents around the world is the ’90s. The ’90s, which was known for its relaxed and easygoing sense of style, produced plenty of awesome trends, many of which have already made a comeback. In this article, we take a look at some of those trends and show you how you can rock them today. Here’s your ultimate guide to ’90s fashion for men.</p>
            <p class="text">In the ’90s, fashion moved away from the excess of the ‘80s and toward a more relaxed, rebellious and minimalistic mood. The decade saw the birth of grunge as well as a rise in streetwear, sneaker culture and early athleisure. Musicians such as Kurt Cobain, Tupac, and even Justin Timberlake became style icons to many. Silhouettes were loose and oversized, and casual dressing dominated the era. <a class="man" href="https://www.thetrendspotter.net/90s-fashion-men/">source</a></p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="2000s">2000s</h2>
            <p class="text">Many clothing trends in the 2000s were born out of globalization, the rise of fast fashion (affordable clothes based off runway designs usually found in department stores like Mervyn’s, J.C. Penney, and Macy’s), and celebrities’ growing influence as style icons. As with all decades, looks and trends varied as the ’00s went on, so if you’re tasked with putting an outfit together, don’t assume your tracksuit straight from 2001 will work for every occasion. The 2000s were also home to trends that hit big and burnt out fast. If you’re going for a particular look, be sure that style is from the right time period before heading to set. </p>
            <p class="text"> Technology and Y2K had a huge impact on fashion in the early 2000s. The color palette was filled with shiny black tones and reflective metallics. While some Y2K trends were worn daily, many of these looks were reserved for going out. Popular outfits for women included mesh or handkerchief tops, box-pleated or leather skirts, shiny pants, and sparkly shoes. For men, Y2K looks usually involved leather jackets, a statement dress shirt, and chunky shoes. If you need inspiration, Britney Spears and *NSYNC were trendsetters for this type of style.</p>
            <p class="text"> Casual clothing and leisurewear were the other big trends of the early 2000s. Denim became a staple for men and women, going beyond jeans to shirts, jackets, and hats. If you’re putting together a casual style for women, think crop tops, hoodies, low-rise flared jeans, cargo pants, daisy dukes, jean skirts, off the shoulder tops, ribbed sweaters, with platform sandals, Ugg boots, or sneakers. Common looks for men included, distressed denim, cargo pants, tracksuits, rugby or polo shirts, flip flops, oxford shoes, and sneakers. <a class="man" href="https://www.centralcasting.com/quick-guide-2000s-fashion/">source</a></p>
