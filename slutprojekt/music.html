        <p class="introduction">Throughout the years, musical styles have reflected the society of the time and have evolved with changes in the world. Not only does music change with society but it changes with technological advances as well. As technology changes it can allow new styles to emerge and new ways for people to listen. From radio to television, and records to the internet, music and the way we consume it has dramatically changed in the past seventy years. Even the innovations in the technology used to create musical instruments and recording equipment has effected what styles and songs are made and popular within the music landscape. Throughout this section we will try to briefly cover the types of music that were popular since the 1920's up until the present day by providing lists of genres and artists as well as some historical context. Keep in mind a lot of this information is subjective and we have tried our best to cover the most popular elements of the history of music. <a class="music" href="http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/music.html#1920s">source</a></p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1920s">1920</h2>
            <p class="text">Music in the 1920's was dominated by jazz, blues and the traveling dance bands that played what was popular at the time. Following the devastation of the first World War, Twenties music was quite upbeat and optimistic as the economy boomed and parties roared despite prohibition in the US. The music industry as we know it was just beginning and all things seemed possible.</p>
            <p class="text">Popular Genres: Jazz, Blues, Dance, Broadway, Ragtime, Standards</p>
            <p class="text">Popular Artists:Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong, Ma Rainey, Sophie Tucker, Eddie Cantor, Paul Whiteman, Bessie Smith. <a class="music" href="http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/music.html#1920s">source</a></p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1930s">1930s</h2>
            <p class="text">The 1930s were shaped by the contrasting moods of the Great Depression and the glamorous beginnings of Old Hollywood. Popular music was equally impacted by these forces and as home radios became more common, the music industry began to keep track of and measure the popularity of sheet music and records through sales. The radio program "Your Hit Parade" debuted in 1935 which showcased the most popular songs of the week. Billboard magazine also began publishing their "Hit Parade" on January 4, 1936 as a list of the most popular songs of the time. </p>

            <p class="text">Jazz music evolved into different styles with Swing and Big Band becoming prominent throughout the 1930s and the 1940s. Musical films influenced pop culture and many film stars were also popular singers of the time. Broadway creators moved to Hollywood and adapted their stage shows for a wider audience on the silver screen. Crooners and multi-media solo entertainers grabbed the attention of a younger audience and artists like Rudy Vallee were crowned as some of the first heart throbs, hosting their own shows on radio and making appearances in films all while churning out recorded hits of their own.</p>

            <p class="text">Popular Genres: Swing, Jazz, Country, Traditional Pop, Crooners, Big Band</p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1940s">1940s</h2>
            <p class="text">The music of the 1940's consisted mainly of jazz, big band, and swing. It reflected the pain of World War II while also trying to remain upbeat and looking towards a positive future full of possibilities. Because much of the world was involved in the war during the decade, many artists and groups put their efforts into entertaining troops, especially in the US with the USO (United States Service Organizations).</p>

            <p class="text">Popular Genres: Jazz, Big Band, Swing, Country, Bebop, Novelty Acts, Band Leaders</p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1950s">1950s</h2>
            <p class="text">Music of the 1950's reflected the beginnings of major social changes in the world and in the US, especially. Rock 'n' Roll, R&B, and traditional pop ruled the charts while radio and television connected the country in our musical tastes and exposed the nation to a greater variety of artists and styles. Some of the first major superstars of music emerged from this decade with people like Elvis Presley dominating the airwaves and the minds of young girls.</p>
            <p class="text">The 1950's were a time of changes and the music of the decade both reflected the cultural changes that were happening while still holding on to the societal norms of the past. Following the detrimental effects of World War II, the United States was about to embark on a musical journey that would change the face of music for decades to come. Racial tensions were being strained with the beginning of the civil rights movement and music reflected many of those tensions. Rhythm & Blues (R&B) and Rock 'n' Roll popularized "black" music and many African-American musicians rose to prominence and enjoyed success, but while some were able to reap the benefits of their work, many others were forgotten or denied access to audiences through segregation.</p>

            <p class="text">Popular Genres: Traditional Pop, Rock 'n' Roll, Rhythm & Blues, Country, Jazz, Blues, Calypso, Vocal Jazz</p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1960s">1960s</h2>
            <p class="text">The sounds of the 1960's straddled a large dichotomy between the ultimate commercialism with completely manufactured bands (like The Archies and The Monkees) and revolutionary artistry (Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix) with some of the greatest singer-songwriters and instrumentalists emerging on the scene. There were also many bands and artists that walked the line between commercialism and musical innovation like The Beatles, Simon & Garfunkel, and The Rolling Stones. The Beatles dominated the charts and spurred on the British Invasion that characterized much of the decade.</p>

            <p class="text">Popular Genres: Folk, Surf Rock, Psychedelic Rock, Blues-Rock, Progressive Rock, Garage Rock, Pop, Soul, R&B, Country, British Invasion, Latin Rock, Protest/Music with a Message.</p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1970s">1970s</h2>
            <p class="text">The 1970's served as a bridge between the seriousness of the music that came out of the late sixties and the excessiveness of music from the 1980's. Disco became one of the biggest and most despised trends in music during the decade. It was so pervasive that many established singers and bands came out with disco songs to keep up with the trends, including rockers like Blondie and Rod Stewart. Heavier rock music and punk rock also emerged during the decade, some of it as a retaliation to disco.</p>

            <p class="text">Popular Genres: Disco/Dance, Progressive Rock, Punk, New Wave, Funk, Soul, Glam Rock, Soft Rock, Singer-Songwriter, Folk, Souther Rock/Country Rock, Country-Pop, Power Pop</p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1980s">1980s</h2>
            <p class="text">In the 1980's music was dramatically changed by the introduction of MTV (Music Television). This meant that music videos became more and more of a necessity in order for artists to gain popularity (especially with the youth) and sell records. A greater importance was placed on the appearance of musicians and gimmicks became commonplace. Michael Jackson emerged as one of the most dominant artists of the decade and was helped by his creative music videos and pure talent, with his Thriller album and video setting pop music standards. New Wave and Synth-Pop were popular genres and their electronic sounds fit perfectly with the beginnings of the computer age. Hair Metal bands also became popular during the decade with their theatrical and outrageous music videos and performances. Hip-Hop also came into the mainstream during the decade.</p>

            <p class="text">Popular Genres: New Wave, Synth-Pop, Hair Metal, Hip-Hop, Gothic Rock, Heavy Metal, Pop, Alternative Rock, Hardcore Punk, Contemporary R&B, Country</p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="1990s">1990s</h2>

            <p class="text">Like the sixties, the 1990's was a decade of extremes with under-produced, anti-establishment grunge bands and gangster rappers enjoying just as much success as the overly produced and studio manufactured pop groups. The decade was ruled by powerful singers with Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, and Whitney Houston topping the charts. Many artists' personal problems including drug abuse and rap feuds overshadowed a lot of the talent during the decade as well, with the death of many popular musicians due to drug overdose and the murders of rappers like Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur.</p>

            <p class="text">Popular Genres: Grunge, Alternative/College Rock, Technotronic, Hip-Hop, Gangster Rap, Bubblegum Pop, Boy Bands/Girl Groups, Pop-Punk, Metal, Ska, Contemporary R&B, Country-Pop, Britpop, New Jack Swing, Singer-Songwriter, Hard Rock, Happy Rock</p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;" class="year" id="2000s">2000s</h2>
            <p class="text">The music of the 2000's showcased a variety of genres and it reflected a great deal of the pop music that came from the nineties, with many of the same artists and bands remaining popular between the two decades. For a decade filled with much suffering in terms of the September 11th attacks, two wars in the Middle East, and an economic downturn, a lot of the music had to strike a fine balance between upbeat and optimistic while still reflecting the pain that many experienced. Some of the more popular genres of the decade included Dance-Pop, Indie Rock, and Emo.</p>

            <p class="text">Popular Genres: Dance-Pop, Indie Rock, Emo, Pop-Punk, Contemporary R&B, Hip-Hop, Reggaeton, Electronica, Hard Rock, Alternative Metal, New Wave Revival, Teen Pop, Boy Bands, Internet Stars, Disney Artists, Adult Contemporary, Country, Country-Pop, British Soul, Latin Pop</p>
